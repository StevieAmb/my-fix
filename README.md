### Learning Goals
With this solo project, I gathered everything I learned about
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress

in order to create an app that makes home repair projects accessible to the common human. By gathering home repair videos based on common repair issues in one place, anyone can save themselves money fixing things that at one point seemed insurmountable.

Especially if you already find yourself hoarding a large amount of tools. 
After all, you are really who this app is for.

## Abstract

*Tired of spending money to get someone to fix something you feel you might be able to fix yourself? Do you have a large amount of tools you keep collecting?
Let's put your intuition and tools to good use!*

My Fixings is an app that allows users to choose different areas of the homes they want to make repairs in. Then, based on the amount of tools they have, which should be a lot, because you have a LARGE collection, you can pick which project you want to tackle. If you want to avoid navigating back to home and clicking to the different areas of the home to see a video, you can click "Add To My Projects", and save all of the repairs you want to do around the house. So, once you've collected all of the projects you want to do (much like your tools collection), and get started proving your collection useful. 

I, and this app, believe in you!

to complete the projects.

Don't feel bad about your tools.
Those who misunderstand are fools.

You'll hammer, nail, and pound, and bruise,
you'll collect all that you can use.

While they cower like a mouse.
You'll have a nice and sturdy house.

They may scowl, snipe, and sneer,
They may nag you throughout the year!

But if for your tools, you get in a spat!
Just show their use, there's an app for that!



## Future Goals

Create a backend to allow:
- Create a search functionality that lets a user choose projects they can do based on tools that they have
- The ability to leave comments on a video, in order to leave word on it's usefulness.
- Allow users to leave ratings on a video, and maybe upload a video they think is better for a project.
